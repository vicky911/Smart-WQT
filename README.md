# Smart-WQT
It's my BTech 6th Sem project which aims s to develop a System that would check the quality of water by 
measuring TDS. This system will allow the user to analyze the present water quality in the 
purifier. An Android App will notify if the quality get vary from stability. It is Applicable 
in any remote water plant (Purifier). The MQTT protocol is used for fast data transfer to cloud 
and to App.
